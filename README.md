# Yellow Pad

Yellow Pad is a simple Tkinter/Python application that will store your notes
and things you need to remember in a easy accessible and simple way.

## Dependencies

Yellow Pad is dependant on

1. Python
2. Tkinter

Later versions or commits might make the application dependant on SQLite3.

## TODO

Currently there is no way of storing data in the application so the application
has no real value what so ever other than for learning Tkinter and Python.

Add a scroll bar so that when there are more messages than can be showned at
once in the application, one can scroll through it.
